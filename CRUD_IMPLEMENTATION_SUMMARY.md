## 🚀 How to Test the APIs

### 1. Start the Development Server
The server is already running on `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Test API Endpoint
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/test` to verify all APIs are available

### 3. Example API Calls

#### Register a New User (Admin)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@school.com",
    "password": "admin123",
    "firstName": "School",
    "lastName": "Admin",
    "role": "ADMIN"
  }'
```

#### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@school.com",
    "password": "admin123"
  }'
```

#### Create a Student (after getting token from login)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/students \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "email": "student@school.com",
    "password": "student123",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "rollNumber": "STU001",
    "dateOfBirth": "2005-01-15",
    "address": "123 Main St"
  }'
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### Database Setup
Since the database connection had issues, you'll need to:
1. Set up your PostgreSQL database
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
3. Run `npx prisma db push` to create tables
4. Run `npx prisma generate` to update the client

### Additional Features You Can Add
1. **File Upload API** - For handling documents and images

### Frontend Integration
Your existing React components in the `src/app/` directory can now be connected to these APIs for full functionality.
